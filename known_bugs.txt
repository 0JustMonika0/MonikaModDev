I would really appreciate it if you figured out what was wrong with the following:

  1. Pressing return key on screen player_input causes loop to skip to next Monika monologue
     	      I think this is caused by some sort of weird interaction with renpy.pause(), since it works fine if pause hasn't returned control yet
